I mainly contributed to:
  admin page, made sure the fake data would work with the actual app
  url mappings
  views functions
  models
I also worked on:
  making important changes so that the web app would work, including the init.py, url and pages and variable references in the html files.
  I also set up image hosting and user/movie's reference to their images.
