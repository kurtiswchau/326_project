<h2>Team Knock Out </h2>
<h3>Flick - Don’t Watch a Movie Alone Ever Again!</h3>
Fall 2018

Overview: Our team is creating an application where an individual can schedule a time, request a party of up to 5 people, and match with those people to watch a movie of their choice. It is called “Flick”. This application is unique in its own way as there are no technologies available in society today for a match movie system for people. The whole idea of this application is so that no one has to watch a movie alone if they don’t want to, and can use this application to make friends around the UMass or Five College campuses. This application consists of 5 web pages, a homepage where all the movies are listed, a page where an individual can request to watch a specific movie at a certain time of their choice, and a location of their preference with people they want to watch it with.
