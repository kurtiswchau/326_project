	<p>Hello! Yes, I know my profile picture is a tree. Long story. Anyways, I'm a pretty casual movie goer, but only because of time. Now that I got the time to watch more, I'm not exactly sure how to go about it. I thought this site would be a pretty good place to start. I can enjoy movies of almost any genre except horror. Anyone reading this, feel free to send me an invite.</p>
